│   └── vizionscope/ # VizionScope artwork
└── fashion/          # Fashion/merchandise images
```

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: WebP (preferred) or optimized JPG/PNG
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `ttrac-hero.webp`)
- **Optimization**: Compress before adding (target <200KB for large images)

## Placeholder Images

Until actual images are added, you can:
1. Use placeholder services: https://placehold.co
2. Create simple colored rectangles with text
3. Use your design tools to create temporary placeholders

## Quick Placeholder Generator

For development, you can use this URL pattern:
```
https://placehold.co/1200x600/6C5CE7/FFFFFF?text=Project+Name
```

Replace dimensions and colors as needed.
