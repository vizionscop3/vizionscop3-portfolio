# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Install Dependencies First

## Quick Start

**Before you can run the project, you MUST install dependencies:**

```bash
cd /Users/vizion/Developer/PORTFOLIO/vizionscop3-portfolio
npm install
```

This will take 2-5 minutes. Wait for it to complete.

## Verify Installation

After `npm install` finishes, check:

```bash
ls node_modules
ls package-lock.json
```

Both should exist.

## Then Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000

## Current Status

- ✅ Project code: Complete
- ✅ Git repository: Initialized and pushed
- ❌ Dependencies: **NOT INSTALLED YET** ← Run `npm install` now!

See `INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.md` for detailed instructions.
